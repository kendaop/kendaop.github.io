## Introducing the all-new 2014 HERP DERP!!!
Haven't you ever wanted to plot stuff on a graph, and then fit a linear model to the data, and then,
plot more stuff on the graph, and then RE-FIT the linear model to the new data?!
  
#### I know I have!  
<br/>
  That's why I'm introducing the 2014 model

## It HERPs!
Start with some pre-loaded data and see it plotted and fit to a linear model.  
Like this!

```{r}
par(cex=2, pch=20, oma=c(1,1,0,0))
data = data.frame(x=c(1:4), y=c((1:4)^2))
fit = lm(y~x, data=data)
plot(data$y ~ data$x, col="blue", xlab="X", ylab="Y")
abline(fit, col="red", lwd=2)
```

## It DERPs!  
Add some more data points, and watch it RE-FIT the linear model!!! In real time!!! Not fake time!!!  
__OH MY!!!__
```{r}
data = rbind(data, c(5, 5^2), c(6, 6^2))
fit = lm(y~x, data=data)
plot(data$y ~ data$x, col="blue", xlab="X", ylab="Y", pch=20, cex.axis=2, cex.lab=2)
abline(fit, col="red", lwd=2)
```

## And it will never let you down.
Long after you're dead, this app will still be kickin'.  
That's the __POWER__ of the internet, baby!
